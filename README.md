# Inventory Management System

The Inventory Management System is a Python based GUI app using Tkinter and PostgresDB to streamline the tracking, organization, and control of inventory.
The system provides real-time visibility into stock levels, automates invoice generation, and helps optimize inventory turnover to reduce costs and improve efficiency.
With real-time data updates and automatically generated sale invoices, you can create, update and manage your products, the available stock, suppliers, employees and product categories.

The app operates with two distinct user access levels: ADMIN and Employee. Employees have a separate dashboard with limited access, allowing them only to record sales and update their personal settings such as email, address, and password. Only Admins have the ability to manage employees, products, suppliers and categories.
