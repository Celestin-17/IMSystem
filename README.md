# Inventory Management System

The Inventory Management System is a Python based GUI app using Tkinter and PostgresDB to streamline the tracking, organization, and control of inventory.
The system provides real-time visibility into products and stock levels, sales records with automated invoice generation and you can also keep track of suppliers and employees.

The app operates with two distinct user access levels: ADMIN and Employee. Employees have a separate dashboard with limited access, allowing them only to record sales and update their personal settings such as email, address, and password. Only Admins have the ability to manage employees, products, suppliers and categories.
